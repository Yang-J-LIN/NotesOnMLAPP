# NotesOnMLAPP

## Introduction
This repository includes my notes on MLAPP(*Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective*, Kelvin P. Murphy).

The notes is composed of:
* Summary of the knowledge in the book.
* Some supplementary materials I collected to help understand the text.
* My understanding and ideas on the topics.
* My answers of the excecises.

Once I finished reading a chapter, I will upload a note in pdf.

Feel free to contact me if you have anything to supplement or question.
